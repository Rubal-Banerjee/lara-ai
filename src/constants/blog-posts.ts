      "Maybe you are a business owner who has just called one of your suppliers, and you get swift, practically seamless service from the agent at the other end. But when you pay close attention, you realize you are interacting with a program, not a person. Welcome, artificial intelligence. Or maybe you are a college student whose roommate wants you to glance over his latest term paper before he turns it in, and it reads better than anything he is asked you to edit before. Welcome, ChatGPT. But, really, how welcome is either? It is a question business leaders of the world have been grappling with for years. Artificial intelligence (AI), which once seemed like science fiction, has been expanding its presence in our lives for decades. It now can be found in our homes, our cars, our retail interactions, and many points in between.",

    title: "The Role Of AI In Healthcare",
    description1:
      "Like every other industry, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of healthcare and medicine. This emerging technology and its capabilities can revolutionize medicine by redefining the doctor-patient relationship and could save the healthcare industry $360 billion a year, according to McKinsey and Harvard. In this article, I will look at how it may have more of an impact on the healthcare industry than initially meets the eye and what facets of the sector AI can revolutionize.",

      "One of the major applications of AI in healthcare is when used in medical imaging and diagnostics. Algorithms are being trained on immense amounts of medical data to analyze CT scans, MRIs, X-rays, microscopy images and other medical visuals. With this training, AI can identify abnormalities, such as tumors, infections or fractures. In some cases, these AI systems have proven more accurate than healthcare professionals in detecting anomalies when diagnosing written test cases of realistic illnesses. Likewise, Google developed a deep learning model that could detect breast cancer in mammograms that showed great accuracy and fewer false positives and negatives than human radiologists. Models like this one are trained on thousands of previous mammograms to identify telltale signs of breast cancer, including irregular shapes, sizes and edges of lesions. This application of AI could reduce instances of misdiagnosis, whether that be false positives or negatives. Deep learning diagnostic performance models will likely quickly become an invaluable tool for healthcare professionals, assisting them in providing better patient care. Like with applications in other industries, AI can also be used to assist human specialists with menial tasks to bolster productivity at healthcare institutions. For example, AI can help to reduce inventory losses during reconciliation. By infusing computer vision and edge devices into the reconciliation process, AI can automate the manual process of identifying and counting the inventory in a surgical tray.",
